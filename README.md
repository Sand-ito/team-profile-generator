Hi! My name is Josh, welcome to my Team Profile Generator.

[link to demo!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AOV-zmcBE3wNnq6djGcL4rACwAv570-U/view)

[here is a link to the repo](https://github.com/Sand-ito/team-profile-generator)

To operate the app just change to the main directory on your machine, and use the `node app.js` command. You should then be prompted to start with making a manager and then add engineers and interns to your liking. Once you have made profiles for everyone on your team just select the option to stop making them. After that you should have a new folder called "output". Inside that folder will be your HTML with your team on it! If you need help to operate you can use the first link in this document its a live demo.

Thank you so much for your time looking through my code. I appreciate all the feedback you can give me.

Have a nice day!

-Josh
